We were able to take on a more ambitious project as a result. We planned to design a DAQ (Data Aquisition) so that the entire team would be able to analyse the performance of the car during testing in amost real time.</p>\n<p>The team had members of varying experience, and as a Software Engineering major, I was most suited to write the communication algorithm so that are various on board computers could communicate to the central data collection arduino without running out of space. We tried several different methods of communication and settled on using serial data transmission.</p>\n<p>Once we had the data, it became another task to represent it. After sending over the resulting data to other subsystems, they came back to us saying that it was impossible to graph since the files were too big and woud crash exel every time they tried. Luckily, in my experience programming for SciPy, I had relied upon the <code class=\"language-text\">matplotlib</code> library to graph data, and it was a fairly simple task to graph what they needed.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/df9da/plots.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 15.18987341772152%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAADCAYAAACTWi8uAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAAc0lEQVQI1z1NQRIDMQja//+2e+kqqAXTNjMGRYFr9Lp7SA4IFU+V+xJfy0fGVGkuCrn4092ve3d+lz8PERJomU9ORg4hE/cpDlxjm7DrlHvdM3Og25L539BJJiFhWShEHmyLFJDvGAQ2EI9uHbbhJ6y/hh9vrezHKhC/ogAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"plots\"\n        title=\"plots\"\n        src=\"/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/f058b/plots.png\"\n        srcset=\"/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/c26ae/plots.png 158w,\n/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/6bdcf/plots.png 315w,\n/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/f058b/plots.png 630w,\n/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/40601/plots.png 945w,\n/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/78612/plots.png 1260w,\n/swallan.github.io/static/e668a79898b7a0ca2f73a0fc653b6978/df9da/plots.png 12000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On the Cal Poly Racing Team","date":"October 2019","isCurrent":false,"endDate":"March 2020","description":"Cal Poly Baja SAE is a student run club on the Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, campus."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cal-poly-racing/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ariat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Softare Engineering Intern: Ariat International"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/campus-dining/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Student Web Developer; Technology Specialist: Cal Poly Corporation"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2511339400","2841359383"]}
