## Overview 
As an undergraduate research assistant, I have been contributing to the Scientific Python ("SciPy") since November of 2019 under various research grants. Under supervision of a professor on campus, I have made enhancements to `scipy.stats` and `scipy.linalg`.

Most recently, under the grant, "A Solid Foundation for Statistics in Python with SciPy," we have worked to make enhancements in several areas to SciPy's statistical functions. See the full grant proposal [here](https://warrenweckesser.github.io/czi/scipy-2019-czi-proposal-revised.pdf). Most notably, I worked to
  - increase the speed and accuracy of continuous distributions fit methods
  - Addition of the Alexander-Govern statistical test

Under a NumFOCUS grant, we made enhancements to `scipy.linalg` by wrapping 8 new fortran functions. I participated in this project by creating a parametrized unit test suite for each Fortran Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) prior to the wrapper being written.
